**Note:** to download and install dependencies, execute `bundle install` at project root. A working installation of Ruby is required.

#### CI Pipeline

| :traffic_light: `Continuous Integration (CI)` | Automatic E2E testing of this role is accomplished leveraging the [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/0x0I/chef-cookbook-template) test infrastructure platform and is executed on each pull request.
